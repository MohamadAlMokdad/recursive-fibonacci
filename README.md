# ðŸŒŸ Recursive Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Python program calculates the **Fibonacci sequence** up to `n` Fibonacci numbers using recursion. The sequence starts from `0` and continues by summing the previous two numbers. ðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“‹ Example Output

For example, if you input `n = 6`, the output will include exactly **6 Fibonacci numbers**, starting from `0`:

```bash
Fibonacci sequence with 6 elements: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
