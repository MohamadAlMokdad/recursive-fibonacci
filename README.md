# ðŸŒŸ Recursive Fibonacci Sequence Generator

This Python program calculates the **Fibonacci sequence** up to the `n`th Fibonacci number using recursion. The sequence starts from `0` and continues by summing the previous two numbers. ðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“‹ Example Output

For example, if you enter `n = 6`, the output will be:

```bash
Fibonacci sequence up to the 6th number: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8]
