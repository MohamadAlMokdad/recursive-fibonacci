# ðŸŒŸ Fibonacci Sequence Calculator

This Python program calculates the **Fibonacci number** for a given integer `n` using recursion. The Fibonacci sequence is defined as follows:

- \( F(0) = 0 \)
- \( F(1) = 1 \)
- For \( n > 1 \), \( F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \)

This sequence is commonly used in mathematics and computer science for problems involving recursion, dynamic programming, and more. ðŸ“Š

## ðŸ“‹ Example Output

For example, if you enter `n = 6`, the output will be:

```bash
The 6th Fibonacci number is 8
